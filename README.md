# The Luper Ledger

A family shared-reward app. Kids and parents earn approved points that pour into three **family** vault meters; nobody has a personal score to compete over. (Constellation Crew skin comes later.)

> **Phase 1 of 6 — Foundation. Do not expect the full app.**
>
> This build ships the runnable skeleton, real seed data, auth, and the meter math that later phases plug into. There is no inbox, no kid Earn screen, no rewards, no calendar gate. If you log in as a kid you will see a stub with "Phase 4" / "Phase 5" placeholders; that is intentional.

## Phase map

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation: shell, auth, data model, seed catalog, meter engine, admin verify screen | **this repo** |
| 2 | Parent inbox + ledger writes | not started |
| 3 | Parent Add earn (Path B + demerits) | not started |
| 4 | Kid Home + Earn | not started |
| 5 | Kid Rewards + basic Wins | not started |
| 6 | Calendar gate (Mon–Sat ~8pm Denver, Sunday celebrate) | not started |

## Run it

Requires Node 20.11+ (tested on Node 22).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://127.0.0.1:4177
npm test           # vitest: meter math, seed counts, Denver time helpers
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build
npm run lint       # oxlint
```

### Logins

Pick a name on the login screen. Session is remembered in `localStorage`.

| User | Role | Band |
|------|------|------|
| Kameron | little | little |
| Alea | little | little |
| Christopher | teen | teen |
| Admin (shared parent login) | admin | — |

Admin PIN defaults to `1234`. Override by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and setting `VITE_ADMIN_PIN`. This is a **Phase 1 placeholder** (`TODO(prod-auth)` in `src/auth/session.ts`), not real security.

### Admin verify screen

Log in as Admin and open **Verify** (`/admin/verify`). It shows:

- T1 / T2 / T3 fill, percentage, and any tracked overflow
- **Simulate +10 approved points** (expect T1 +5, T2 +3, T3 +2), **Simulate −5 demerit**, **Reset meters**
- Seeded act counts by band against the locked expectations (little 18, teen 23, conduct 8, parent 13)

## Stack

- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui-style primitives (`src/components/ui`)
- react-router-dom 7
- Vitest

## Persistence: repository layer over localStorage

Phase 1 uses a **repository layer over `localStorage`** rather than a server + SQLite. The whole database is one JSON snapshot under the key `luper-ledger:db`.

- `src/data/types.ts` — tables: `users`, `earnActs`, `ledger` (approved points only), `pendingClaims` (empty for now), `vaultMeters` (T1/T2/T3), `settings` (verse placeholder, schema version).
- `src/data/repository.ts` — `StorageAdapter` interface (`load` / `save` / `clear`) and the typed `Repository` on top of it.
- `src/data/localStorageRepository.ts` — the adapter the app uses.
- `src/data/memoryRepository.ts` — in-memory adapter for tests and storage-less environments.

Swapping to SQLite later means writing one more `StorageAdapter`; UI and engine do not change. Seeding runs automatically the first time the store is empty (or when `schemaVersion` changes).

### Kid safety rule

The repository exposes **no per-user or per-sibling totals**. The only aggregate is `getMeters()` (family-wide). Ledger reads are prefixed `admin*` and are only reached from admin routes behind `RequireAdmin`. Please keep it that way in later phases.

## Meter engine

`src/engine/meters.ts` is pure and fully unit-tested.

- Every approved entry (positive or negative) is split **50% T1 / 30% T2 / 20% T3**.
- Meters fill at **T1 = 120, T2 = 280, T3 = 560** points.
- No personal caps: a single large entry is applied in full.
- Values are stored as integer tenths so the split is exact for any integer point amount.
- Points above a meter's fill are **tracked as overflow**, not discarded, and never shorten a period. Period timelines are calendar-based and arrive in Phase 6.
- Negative points drain overflow first, then the visible meter, never below zero.

Key exports: `splitPoints(points)`, `applyLedgerEntry(meters, points)`, `initialMeters()`, `meterPercent(meter)`.

## Denver time

`src/lib/time/denver.ts` provides `toDenverParts`, `nowInDenver`, `denverDateKey`, `isDenverSunday`, and `formatDenver`, all pinned to `America/Denver` via `Intl`. No cutoff logic yet; Phase 6 builds on these.

## Seed catalog

`src/data/seed/acts.ts` holds the locked lists. Each act carries `band`, `points`, `path` (`A` kid-claimable / `B` parent-stamped), and `pathBStamp`. Conduct acts exist twice (little / teen values) via `audience`.

| Band | Acts | All Path B? |
|------|------|-------------|
| little | 18 | no (4 Path B) |
| teen | 23 | no (10 Path B) |
| conduct | 8 | yes |
| parent | 13 | yes |
